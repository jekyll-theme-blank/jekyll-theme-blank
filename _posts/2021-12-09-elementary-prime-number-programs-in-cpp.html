I have been re-learning programming lately using C++.

After Hello World, I wrote a simple program about prime numbers.

Primality test
--------------

A natural number n > 1 is prime if and only if it is not divisible by any natural number i such that 2 <= i <= n – 1. The numbers 0 and 1 are not prime.

A simple C++ program to print the primes less than or equal to 100 would be as follows:

    #include <iostream>
    
    // Returns whether `n` is prime.
    bool is_prime(int n) {
      if (n <= 1) {
        return false;
      }
    
      for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
          return false;
        }
      }
    
      return true;
    }
    
    int main() {
      // Prints the prime numbers less than or equal to 100.
      for (int n = 0; n <= 100; n++) {
        if (is_prime(n)) {
          std::cout << n << std::endl;
        }
      }
    }

    ⋊> g++ -Ofast -std=c++2a -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic-errors -o main main.cc; and time ./main | wc -l
          25

This algorithm is called trial division, which attempts to divide n by smaller numbers.
